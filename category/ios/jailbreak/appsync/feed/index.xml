										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back I used an app called JailCoder to enable me to run and debug my own apps on my jailbroken iPhone 5S without having to pay Apple for a full developer account. I&#8217;m still learning iOS development and I have nothing I want to submit to the app store, so I&#8217;m reluctant to pay the £100 that Apple wants to enable me to run my own code on my own device.</p>
<p>Given that XCode is free, and that £100 per year would gives me the ability to sell apps through the app store, I think it&#8217;s a bargain if you are actually planning to distribute apps, but for me just learning it seems a bit steep.</p>
<p>There don&#8217;t seem to be many tutorials out there telling you how to do this for iOS8.1 and XCode 6.1 (they are all a bit outdated), but this is what worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your Jailbroken device install AppSync Unified 5.2-1 (or later) from AngelXWind&#8217;s repo. Don&#8217;t use any other AppSync, and if you have others, be sure to remove them.</li>
<li>Open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/SDKSettings.plist and change AD_HOC_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED to YES. You may need to duplicate it to the desktop, change it, save it, then drag and drop back into the original folder because OS X let you edit the file in place.</li>
<li>If XCode was running, restart XCode.</li>
<li>Change your Project and Target settings to &#8220;Ad Hoc Code Sign&#8221; in Build Settings</li>
<li>Tell XCode to run app on iPhone. At this point XCode will put app on your iDevice, but can’t debug because it can&#8217;t attach to the process. The app will start then close immediately. You can now manually start the app on the phone now though.</li>
<li>To enable debugging: In your project select File&gt;New File Property List and create a file called &#8220;Entitlements.plist&#8221;. Add “Can be debugged” or “get-task-allow” (both do the same thing) and set the value to YES.</li>
<li>Now change your Project and Target Code Signing Entitlements (In Build Settings) to &#8220;Entitlements.plist&#8221; (you have to type it in).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now XCode can run and debug the app. Good luck</p>
<p>Note that some poeple have issues because they have other appsyncs installed. Remove all other appsyncs and install AppSync Unified from http://cydia.angelxwind.net/ (you&#8217;ll have to add this repo to cydia)</p>
<p>Thanks to Karen and Linus for developing AppSync Unified.</p>
