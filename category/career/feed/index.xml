										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous blog post, I said that I attended B-Sides London earlier this year. It turns out that was probably one of the best things I&#8217;ve done this year because, not only was it very enjoyable, but I ended up speaking to a quite a lot of people while I was there, including some people that worked at security companies that were recruiting and I ended up getting a job at a company that is well known in the infosec world.</p>
<p>It was about time I moved on from my previous position, and this is a real step up for me. I&#8217;ve been working there for a few weeks now and I&#8217;m really enjoying it, the work is fun and interesting, the working environment is brilliant. It&#8217;s just great to be working in a field that I&#8217;m interested in and be somewhere that cares about career progression.</p>
