										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, while developing a geocaching app for pebble smartwatches called <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004">&#8220;Watch Caching&#8221;</a>, I noticed a bug that could have security implications, so I reported it to Pebble using <a href="https://www.pebble.com/legal/white_hat/">the whitehat guidelines set out by theme</a></p>
<p>It took them a while, but they eventually got back to me and agreed that it was a security vulnerability and wanted to offer me a significant financial reward, as well as put me in the <a href="https://www.pebble.com/legal/white_hat/hall_of_fame">Pebble White Hat Hall of Fame</a></p>
<p>This also took a while to come to fruition, but they did hold true to their word and sent me the money, followed a few days later by my name being added to the <a href="https://www.pebble.com/legal/white_hat/hall_of_fame">Pebble White Hat Hall of Fame</a>!</p>
