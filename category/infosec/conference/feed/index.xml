										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous blog post, I said that I attended B-Sides London earlier this year. It turns out that was probably one of the best things I&#8217;ve done this year because, not only was it very enjoyable, but I ended up speaking to a quite a lot of people while I was there, including some people that worked at security companies that were recruiting and I ended up getting a job at a company that is well known in the infosec world.</p>
<p>It was about time I moved on from my previous position, and this is a real step up for me. I&#8217;ve been working there for a few weeks now and I&#8217;m really enjoying it, the work is fun and interesting, the working environment is brilliant. It&#8217;s just great to be working in a field that I&#8217;m interested in and be somewhere that cares about career progression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a day off from work on Wednesday last week to go to <a href="https://www.securitybsides.org.uk/">B-Sides London</a>, and had probably the best day this year! There were so many interesting talks and loads of great people to chat to (and potential job opportunities). I even won a wristband which game me access to the <a href="https://www.mwrinfosecurity.com/">MWR</a> sponsored afterparty with free drinks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The most entertaining talk by far was byÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/info_dox">@info_dox</a>Â titled &#8220;A look at TR-06FAIL and other CPE Configuration Disasters&#8221;. Darren showed up with a pint in his hand and proceeded to tell us all about the problems with theÂ <a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/">Broadband Forum</a>&#8216;s protocols and their various implementations.</p>
<p>I came away with a bit of swag too, 3 T-Shirts, and a signed copy of &#8220;Breaking Into Information Security by <a href="https://twitter.com/zephrfish">Andy Gill</a> (which reminds me, I must get in contact with him for the digital copy he promised me).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say a big thank you to all the volunteers who made it such a great event. Hopefully in the future, I&#8217;ll be able to give something back by helping out at one of these events, or something similar.</p>
