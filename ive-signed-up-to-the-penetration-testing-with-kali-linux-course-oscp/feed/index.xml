Hi,

Well I booked 60 days, but about 14 of those I was on holiday (bad timing, I know!) so I only really got 46 days of lab access, and I didn&#039;t manage to study on all of those days... Needless to say that when my 60 days were up, I was not ready (and still aren&#039;t) to take the exam. I understand all the theory, but I&#039;ve only owned about 4 machines in the lab (I&#039;ve not been using metasploit for any of them, since it&#039;s use is restricted in the exam to one system), and it takes me much longer that it should to do it. I&#039;ve decided to practice some machines on vulnhub before buying extra lab time. I&#039;m hoping that once I&#039;ve got more experience outside the labs and I&#039;m faster, I may manage to be ready after buying a 30 day extension.

Are you doing the PWK course, or considering doing it?]]></description>
