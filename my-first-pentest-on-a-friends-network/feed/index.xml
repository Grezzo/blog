That&#039;s a great idea, nice one. Unfortunately he&#039;s tightened up his security and removed most of the attack surface that I used, so I&#039;d have to start all over.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey. Just wondering -- what about sniffing the UnRAID credentials? You said that it&#039;s running over basic access authentication, which is only base64 encoded. Maybe that interface is running over HTTPS, but you now have root so you can get the certificate for that, start sniffing traffic, and then have your friend log into UnRAID. You could even sabotage UnRAID to force him to login and fix it if asking him to log in is not realistic.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure as I don&#039;t have an UnRAID box myself, but I can&#039;t see why not. I know someone who uses UnRAID and probably also uses transmission so I can ask them if you&#039;d like?

Update: Oh - this person used both, though transmission wasn&#039;t running on his UnRAID sever. I&#039;ll ask them if they moved transmission over to the UnRAID]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I would like to subscibe to your blog. Frequency of updates doesn&#039;t matter, at least you won&#039;t spam my RSS reader ;) But of course, that depends on you, I never set up RSS feed before so I have no idea how much trouble it is.]]></description>

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the comment. To be honest I didn&#039;t think I would update this blog often enough that anyone would want to subscribe to an RSS feed, but if you&#039;d like I can probably set that up?]]></description>
