Are you trying to run the shell script yourself? That won&#039;t work because you don&#039;t have permissions, but the cron job does. Just stick your .sh file in the writeable.d folder and because the writable.sh script runs everything in that folder, it will be run by the cron job. You may have to wait up to 3 minutes for it to be run by cron.]]></description>

Are you saying that it didn&#039;t work when you tried it? I&#039;m pretty sure that when I wrote this, I did the steps afterwards to make sure that I hadn&#039;t missed anything out.]]></description>
